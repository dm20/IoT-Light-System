# iOT-Light-System
These programs are used to interface with an HC-05 Bluetooth module and Arduino Uno.

The GUI created in Processing sends commands to the HC-05, which then
transmits the data to the Arduino for the purpose of driving an LED.

If you are searching for a solution for implementing a slider bar in Processing, then this repo will be very useful for you.

The GUI is shown below.
